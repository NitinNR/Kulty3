# 🔧 Fixes Applied

## Tailwind CSS v4 PostCSS Configuration

### Issue
Tailwind CSS v4 moved the PostCSS plugin to a separate package (`@tailwindcss/postcss`), causing build errors.

### Fixes Applied

### 1. ✅ Installed @tailwindcss/postcss
```bash
npm install -D @tailwindcss/postcss
```

### 2. ✅ Updated postcss.config.js
Changed from:
```js
export default {
  plugins: {
    tailwindcss: {},
    autoprefixer: {},
  },
}
```

To:
```js
export default {
  plugins: {
    '@tailwindcss/postcss': {},
  },
}
```

### 3. ✅ Updated index.css
Changed from:
```css
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```

To:
```css
@import "tailwindcss";
```

### 4. ✅ Updated tailwind.config.js
- Removed `extend` wrapper (not needed in v4)
- Added all color definitions at the root level
- Added scrollbar styling

### 5. ✅ Fixed QRCode Import
Changed from:
```js
import QRCode from 'qrcode.react';
```

To:
```js
import { QRCodeSVG as QRCode } from 'qrcode.react';
```

### 6. ✅ Added "type": "module" to frontend/package.json
This eliminates PostCSS module warning during build.

## Build Status

✅ **Build Successful!**
```
✓ 405 modules transformed
✓ built in 370ms

## Next Steps

The frontend is now fully configured and ready to run:

```
